![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO-BLE/bletpyecconnect.png)

#### Step 2.2: Upload ReadXIAOAccelerometer.ino sketch

```
// XIAO BLE Sense LSM6DS3 Data  Forwarder 

#include "LSM6DS3.h"
#include "Wire.h"

//Create a instance of class LSM6DS3
LSM6DS3 myIMU(I2C_MODE, 0x6A);  //I2C device address 0x6A

#define CONVERT_G_TO_MS2 9.80665f
#define FREQUENCY_HZ 50
#define INTERVAL_MS (1000 / (FREQUENCY_HZ + 1))

static unsigned long last_interval_ms = 0;


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial)
    ;

  if (myIMU.begin() != 0) {
    Serial.println("Device error");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Device OK!");
  }
}



void loop() {
  if (millis() > last_interval_ms + INTERVAL_MS) {
    last_interval_ms = millis();
    Serial.print(myIMU.readFloatAccelX() * CONVERT_G_TO_MS2, 4);
    Serial.print('\t');
    Serial.print(myIMU.readFloatAccelY() * CONVERT_G_TO_MS2, 4);
    Serial.print('\t');
    Serial.println(myIMU.readFloatAccelZ() * CONVERT_G_TO_MS2, 4);
  }
}

```

Upload the abobe code to your XIAO Sense and open the serial monitor or serial ploter to see the accelerometer data.

#### Step 2.3: Install the XIAO to the hand using the Strap provided. 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/bandInstalled.png)

Install the band on your hand as mentioned on the above image and then move you hand after opeing the Serial montior or Serial plotter. 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/raawIMUSerial.png)

You can also see the data over the Serial Plotter. 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/raawIMUSerialplotter.png)


## Step 3:  Connect to Edge impulse and Forward Accelerometer data  üéõÔ∏è. 

As of now, we can see the accelerometer data from from the XIAO using arduino IDE serial monitor, now we need to forward the data to the edge impulse for post processing. 

### Step 3.1: Create an Edge Impulse project. 

First, we need to create an edge impulse account. for that go to https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/login select **Sign Up**, or if you already have an account enter **Username/Email** and **password**.

![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1323148/image_uJbGxfMuNw.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=740&h=555&fit=max)

### Step 3.2: Create Edge Impulse Project

After creating an account, we need to create an edgeImpulse project. For that click your profile and select Create a new project or use this [URL](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/select-project#create-new-project). 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/newproject.png)

Then provide a project name, then click **Create new project** . 

![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1323155/image_MYIOqUbxwg.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=740&h=555&fit=max)

Next, you can see the studio page, which means you successfully created an edge Impulse project üéâ

![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1323156/image_JUOIG1bLjI.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=740&h=555&fit=max)


## Step 4: Connect the XIAO with EdgeImpulse and start collect data ü™£. 

Next, we need to connect the XIAO with the edgeimpulse to collect the data, and for that you need follow the below steps. 

### Steps 4.1 Install Edge impulse CLI in your computer. 

This Edge Impulse CLI is used to control local devices, act as a proxy to synchronise data for devices that don't have an internet connection, and to upload and convert local files. The CLI consists of seven tools:

* [edge-impulse-daemon](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-daemon) - configures devices over serial, and acts as a proxy for devices that do not have an IP connection.
* [edge-impulse-uploader](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-uploader) - allows uploading and signing local files.
* [edge-impulse-data-forwarder](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-data-forwarder) - a very easy way to collect data from any device over a serial connection, and forward the data to Edge Impulse.
* [edge-impulse-run-impulse](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-run-impulse) - show the impulse running on your device.
* [edge-impulse-blocks](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-blocks) - create organizational transformation, custom dsp, custom deployment and custom transfer learning blocks.
* [himax-flash-tool](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/himax-flash-tool) - to flash the Himax WE-I Plus


#### Installation - Windows
1. Create an [Edge Impulse account](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup).
2. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) on your host computer.
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or higher on your host computer.
    * For Windows users, install the Additional Node.js tools (called Tools for Native Modules on newer versions) when prompted.
4. Install the CLI tools via:
    ``npm install -g edge-impulse-cli --force``

You should now have the tools available in your PATH.

#### Installation - Linux, Ubuntu, MacOS, and Raspbian OS

1. Create an [Edge Impulse account](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup).
2. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) on your host computer.
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or higher on your host computer.
Alternatively, run the following commands:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
node -v
```
The last command should return the node version, v14 or above.
Let's verify the node installation directory:
``npm config get prefix``
If it returns /usr/local/, run the following commands to change npm's default directory:
```
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
```
On MacOS you might be using zsh as default, so you will want to update the correct profile
```
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```
4. Install the CLI tools via:
``npm install -g edge-impulse-cli``
You should now have the tools available in your PATH.

For more details, check here https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-installation. 

### Steps 4.2 Connect the XIAO to the Edgeimpulse project we created 

We need to connect the XIAO board to a specific project. For that, follow th steps after installig the edge impulse CLI 

Enter the command ``edge-impulse-data-forwarder`` CLI to start the data forwarder and provide the information. It's similar to below image

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/cliconnnect.png)
 1. Run command ``edge-impulse-data-forwarder`` 
 2. Enter edge impulse account email account 
 3. Enter edge impulse account password
 4. Select project from the list. 

After selecting the project, we need to describe the data as below. 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/cliconnnect2.png)
 1. Name the sensor values as ```accX,accY,accZ``` 

That's all, then open the Edge impulse project page, you can seee the device connected there.

### Step 4.3 Start collecting Data. 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/conenctedDevice.png)

After following the step 4.2, we can see the device connected to the edge impulse and we can see it's listed as above image. 

![](../tiny-ml-workshop/img/sense/dataCollection.png)

Choose **Data Aquisition** option and provide the **lable** of data we are collecting and click start **"Start Sampling"**, For this project we are collecting data for **Standing** , **Sitting** and **Walking** activites for simplicity. Try to collect as much data as possible. 

And you also import the dala, for that download the dataset by clicking [here](../tiny-ml-workshop/src/activitymonitor_xiao_sense-export.zip)
