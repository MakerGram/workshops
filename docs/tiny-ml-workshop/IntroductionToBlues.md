It's important to understand a few key concepts of the Blues ecosystem:

* **The Notecard** is a device-to-cloud data pump that reduces the complexity of building connected solutions with a secure, reliable cellular or Wi-Fi connection. It's a 30x35 millimeter System-on-Module (SOM) that's ready for embedding into any project.

* **Notecarriers** are development boards that help you get started quickly with the Notecard. There are a variety of Notecarriers designed to fit different needs, and many include onboard Cellular and GPS antennas, as well as a USB port for Serial access to the Notecard.

* **Notehub** is the secure cloud service the Notecard uses to send and receive data. Notehub also provides a console for fleet management and secure connectors for routing data to 3rd party cloud applications.
