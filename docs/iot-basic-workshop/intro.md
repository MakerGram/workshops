The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects‚Äî‚Äúthings‚Äù‚Äîthat are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. [src](https://www.oracle.com/in/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/)

###  Why is Internet of Things (IoT) so important?

Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects‚Äîkitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors‚Äîto the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.

By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world‚Äîand they cooperate.
